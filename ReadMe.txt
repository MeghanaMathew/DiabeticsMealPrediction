Project: “Diabetes Meal Detection”

This application aims to detect when a patient consumes a meal solely from the variations in his/her blood glucose levels. Over 12 features were gathered from the time series data provided by the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM), a machine used to track blood glucose. Four different machine learning models were implemented and voting was used to determine the output. I was responsible for training the SVM model, which had an accuracy of about 85%.
